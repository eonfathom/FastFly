# VirtualFly

This repository outlines a methodology for simulating the *Drosophila melanogaster* connectome on a CUDA-enabled GPU using PyTorch.

## Installation

The project can be installed locally using `pip`. To install the package, navigate to the top level directory and use the following command: `pip install requirements.txt`. If you would like to be able to edit the source files while maintainig the package import structure, use `pip install -e . requirements.txt`.

Note that `torch` is not automatically installed, due to the many possible variatons of the library and CUDA versions. Please consult pytorch.org for the correct version for your hardware. As of this writing, the code is known to work for `torch 2.9.0+cu126`.

## Usage

To best understand how to use the software, I recommend first following the jupyter notebooks located in `scripts`, in numerical order.

The organization of the repository is as follows:
* `data`: Directory which stores reference data, namely the connectome parquet/csv files, and any generated sparse weight tensors
* `results`: Results generated by experiments run in the jupyter notebooks
* `scripts`: Example jupyter notebooks which demonstrate the functionality of the software suite
* `src`: Source code of the package
